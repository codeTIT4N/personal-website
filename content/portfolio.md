Currently I am working here as a full time Blockchain Developer.

{{< collapse summary="More Details">}}
1. Blockchain: Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript, Hardhat, [thegraph](https://thegraph.com/ "thegraph website"), GraphQL.
    - Dynamic NFTs ([Showcase in ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dna-dynamic-nft-asset-9zx0r)).
    - Cross chain NFT Lending & Renting using [axelar network](https://axelar.network/ "axelar network website").
    - Non-Custodial NFT Marketplace.
    - Non-Custodial NFT Lending & Renting.
    - Made subgraphs using thegraph for getting data from the blockchain.
2. Frontend: JavaScript, React.Js, Ethers.js, GraphQL, API integrations like NFT data APIs, thegraph etc.
    - Worked on blockchain interactions on the frontend using ethers.js, GraphQL, etc.
3. Backend: Node.Js, Express.Js, MongoDB, JavaScript.
    - Made an API which uses [w3name](https://web3.storage/docs/how-tos/w3name/ "w3name") and [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/ "IPNS") under the hood for [Dynamic NFTs](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dna-dynamic-nft-asset-9zx0r "dynamic NFTs ETH Global showcase").
    - Worked on a smart contract verification tool which creates a custom [ERC721A](https://www.erc721a.org/ "ERC721A website"), [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155 "EIP-1155") or [biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/ "biconomy website") gasless NFT contract and responds with its bytecode and abi, which can then be used by the frontend to make users deploy custom NFT contracts and then finally verify them on block explorers like [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/ "etherscan explorer"), [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/ "polygonscan explorer"), [arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/ "arbiscan explorer"), [snowtrace](https://snowtrace.io/ "snowtrace explorer"), [blockscout](https://blockscout.com/ "blockscout explorer"), etc.
4. Keeping up with the new Blockchain tech like [Account abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337 "EIP-4337"), [Blockchain Interoperability](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-interoperability/ "Blockchain Interoperability Article Chainlink"), etc.
