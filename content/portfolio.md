Currently I am working here as a full time Blockchain Developer.

{{< collapse summary="More Details">}}
1. Blockchain: Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript, Hardhat, [thegraph](https://thegraph.com/ "thegraph website"), GraphQL.
    - Dynamic NFTs - [ETHGlobal Showcase](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dna-dynamic-nft-asset-9zx0r)

    - Non-Custodial NFT Lending & Renting.

2. Frontend: JavaScript, React.Js, Ethers.js, GraphQL, API integrations ([Alchemy NFT API](https://www.alchemy.com/nft-api "NFT API Alchemy website")), thegraph etc.
    - Worked on blockchain interactions on the frontend using ethers.js, GraphQL, etc.
